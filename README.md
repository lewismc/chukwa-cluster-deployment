# chukwa-cluster-deployment

## Introduction
A small utility project used to deploy [Apache Chukwa](http://chukwa.apache.org) (master branch) 
on to an existing [Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org) cluster. It should be noted that this cluster
deployment scenario also works for an [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/) deployment.

## Software Versions
 * Both [Apache Hadoop](http://hadoop.apache.org) and [Amazon EMR](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticmapreduce/) v2.4.0
 * [Apache Chukwa](http://chukwa.apache.org) [master branch](https://github.com/apache/chukwa/tree/master)
 
## Deployment
